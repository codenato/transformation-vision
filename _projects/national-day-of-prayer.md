Thank you to ALL who help make this event a success. We believe prayer touches the heart of God and changes things. Continue to seek God for His guidance in all we say and do throughout our community.

**Join us at the Cedar Hill City-Wide Event**

Transformation Vision prioritizes community involvement in the annual National Day of Prayer (which is the first Thursday in May).  Transformation Vision offers prayer that is open to the community both during the Noon hour and again for an evening community service.  The location for the Noon prayer varies from year to year and the evening service traditionally is held at Cedar Hill High School’s Performing Arts Center.  As time approaches the event each year, this website will provide further details.

**A Prayer for America by Beth Moore**

Father in Heaven,
<br>We lift our eyes toward Your Throne, where You reign in righteousness.
<br>Your Word assures us that when Your people cry out in sincerity and humility, You will never turn a deaf ear to us.
<br>We call upon You now, seeking Your forgiveness and favor.
<br>Look over this fevered landscape and heal us, Lord.
<br>Drop knees to the floor and raise eyes to the sky, for we know where our help comes from.
<br>Unite these States again in devotion to You, and blur every dividing line.
<br>Do not give us over to our sins. Give us, instead, over to passionate prayer that moves Your heart.
<br>“May Your unfailing love rest upon us, O Lord, even as we put our hope in You.”
<br>In the Name of our Lord and Savior,
<br>Amen

**History**

The National Day of Prayer is a vital part of our heritage. Since the first call to prayer in 1775, when the Continental Congress asked the colonies to pray for wisdom in forming a nation, the call to prayer has continued through our history, including President Lincoln’s proclamation of a day of “humiliation, fasting, and prayer” in 1863. In 1952, a joint resolution by Congress, signed by President Truman, declared an annual, national day of prayer. In 1988, the law was amended and signed by President Reagan, permanently setting the day as the first Thursday of every May. Each year, the president signs a proclamation, encouraging all Americans to pray on this day. Last year, all 50 state governors, plus the governors of several U.S. Territories, signed similar proclamations.
