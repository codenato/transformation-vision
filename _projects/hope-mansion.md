Hope Mansion lovingly provides practical partnerships that equip mothers and babies with skills and shelter.&nbsp; Pregnancies in crisis become opportunities to overcome destructive life patterns and allow children in womb a future with hope.

Hope Mansion, a 14,000 square-foot three-story mansion in a secluded area of Cedar Hill,&nbsp; uniquely addresses the despair and hopelessness of women in crisis.&nbsp; Providing residency for women and babies, the facility offers educational and training rooms, supervision by loving house parents, networks with other social supports, as well as necessities like food clothing, counseling, and&nbsp; employment opportunities.&nbsp; After an effective screening service, Hope Mansion provides, free of charge, unparalleled hope though committed friends and resources who value and envision rescued lives and wholeness.

With the opening of Hope Mansion, women in need will find a place to live, learn about life, find purpose for themselves and their baby, and begin a life of hope.&nbsp; Whether they choose a relationship with their baby or adoption, the Hope Mansion support means a chance to change the cycle of hopelessness.

Hope Mansion operates under the umbrella of Transformation Vision Cedar Hill, a Texas nonprofit corporation, an organization with broad support from the business, education, spiritual, civic, and private sectors of Cedar Hill, Texas and the surrounding region.&nbsp; Although Hope Mansion is distinctly Christ-based, it is not affiliated with, or directed by, any particular church or denomination.
