      <div class="editable"><p>People from all walks of life claim Cedar Hill as their place to live, work, play and worship. Our city is centered by the best in politics, economics, government, churches, educational institutions and social structures. But our city also has a line that separates the rich from the poor, the strong from the weak, the haves from the have nots. That line may be a street, a sidewalk, a train track or a creek. It is a line that must be crossed if we are to see our city transformed.</p><p>The heart of Transformation Vision is to cross the lines that separate us and serve all of those represented in our city and community. Meeting the needs of the community not only makes a significant difference in people&rsquo;s lives, but it also reveals the power of the Gospel to affect change in their hearts. We believe God&rsquo;s heart for the broken and downtrodden can be expressed most powerfully in our city by our willingness to partner with the Kingdom of God at work here.</p><p>Transformation Vision, as we steward the blessing and opportunities of God, &nbsp;seeks to engage the city on every level &ndash; spiritually, socially, and economically &ndash; for individuals, neighborhoods and communities. In order to do this, we have a three part strategy by which we seek to effect change:</p></div>

        <p>We believe very strongly in the power of prayer, serving the community through acts of kindness and loving those who are less fortunate.  By praying for, serving and loving those in our community, we are following the same strategy Jesus used to reach the world. That’s why it’s so powerful.</p>
        <p>As we become committed to loving and serving the city and community where God has placed us, we will begin to see God’s kingdom advanced. If we understand the heart of God and the power of the Gospel to change lives, we can have hope for our city, no matter how dark or hopeless it might seem. The mission of God has always been a mission of restoration and redemption. He redeems lives, families and cultures.</p>
        <p>God loves our city. We love our city.  Because of this, we long to be an influential people and to lead influential businesses, churches, governments and beyond to insure the people that make up our city are afforded the opportunity to see His love in action. We will engage the brokenness and the be the peaceful presence that our world is longing for.</p>
        <p>We can’t do everything, but we can do something.  And it all starts here.</p>

          <p class="editable">We can contribute to the wellbeing and heart of the city by involving ourselves in the soil of it.  We believe people will be more likely to listen to the message of the Gospel because we have invested ourselves deeply into the city.

          <p class="editable">We have a mission to establish hope throughout our city and beyond. Establishing this hope starts when we begin to love our city the way Jesus does. That means caring about people who live here - their suffering and pain, heartaches and trials, the oppression they experience, and the injustice they bear. If we are to fulfill the greatest commandment God gave to mankind - <strong> to love the Lord your God with all of your heart, soul and mind, and to love your neighbor as yourself</strong> - then it all starts with how we love.</p>
          <p class="editable">Loving the city is about bringing the influence of the kingdom of God into it. We are called to live as members of God’s Kingdom in the midst of the city, driven by our love for God and the love we have experienced from Him, and compelled by our love for others.</p>
