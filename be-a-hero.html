          <p>Our mission at Hope Mansion cannot be completed without faithful volunteers. We have many different volunteer opportunities and ways for you and/or your group to get involved!</p>
          <p>At Hope Mansion, there is a structured setting were staff and volunteers can facilitate a loving, safe environment for our residents to prepare to have their baby and work on their the long and short term goals. This is accomplished through our Resident Program which includes weekly case management and goal setting, daily classes, mentoring, counseling, basics of how to run a healthy home, how to be a healthy parent (or preparation for adoption) and preparing for the next step in their journey. There are many different ways for you to get involved!</p>

        <p>Orientation &ndash; We host new volunteer orientation meetings on the 3rd Tuesday of each month. The meetings are held at Hope Mansion (1595 Mt Lebanon Rd; Cedar Hill, TX 75104) at 6 pm for those that are new or are interested in learning more about volunteering.</p>
        <p>Training - Ministering to those that are in a time of crisis in their lives is very rewarding, but we also know it is important to be properly equipped. As part of our volunteer program, we provide training to better equip you as you serve at Hope Mansion. Please contact us for more information.</p>
