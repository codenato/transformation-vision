  - description: "My name is Tamara Nelson,\nBefore I came to Hope Mansion I was very stressed and homeless, but that wasn’t the worse part. I was also 41 weeks pregnant with my little Cameron. The first day I came into Hope Mansion was my day of finals. So after being invited to stay I rushed back to school to take my finals. I came back home at 11:00 at night super tired. The next morning Cameron was born. I quickly realized God had brought me to Hope Mansion for a purpose, and I began to change my attitude and thoughts. I was very grateful for being able to bring my baby to a safe warm home. \nBeing at Hope Mansion has changed my way of thinking. I used to blame my momma for everything, because I hadn’t forgiven her. Being at Hope Mansion opened my eyes to a lot. I’ve learned to ask God for everything. I’ve become more grateful for everything. It’s humbling me helping me to have self-control. It has helped me to become a woman of grace, and not to go back to my old ways. Hope Mansion has blessed my life. \nP.S. Thank you for everything."
