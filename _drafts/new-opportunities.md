Greetings!&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Cedar Hill, Texas is home to Bridges Safehouse and Hope Mansion. &nbsp;These two faith-based organizations provide safe shelter and loving environments to help pregnant and homeless women and their children who are in crisis. &nbsp;Exciting plans are now being developed that will unify and strengthen both of these important community-supported ministries.

**Background Information**

Bridges Safehouse is a shelter for homeless women, and women in crisis along with their young children. &nbsp;Each year Bridges serves 60-75 women and children through a 30-day program providing shelter, resources, life-skills, and mentoring while showing them the love and grace available through Jesus Christ.

Hope Mansion is a residential group home for pregnant women age 18 and older who are experiencing a crisis pregnancy. &nbsp;Hope is a loving and caring environment providing housing for women during their pregnancy and up to 6 weeks after their baby is born. &nbsp; The program includes housing, educational and training classes, food, clothing, counseling, mentoring, case management and spiritual guidance with a Christ-centered focus.

**Enhanced Services**

These two sister-organizations have a strong history of cooperation and working together. &nbsp;Their Boards of Directors recently began collaboration discussions to find ways to better coordinate their efforts. &nbsp;They concluded that the development of a new program using the joint leadership and facilities of both ministries could expand and enhance available services they provide to women in crisis and result in significant cost savings. &nbsp;The new program currently under development is being called, "Bridges to Hope."&nbsp;

**Appreciated Support**

This communication is being sent to community leaders as well as the generous donors and faithful volunteers who help us make a difference in the lives of those we serve. &nbsp;Both Hope Mansion and Bridges Safehouse leadership teams want you to know that we appreciate your support and covet your prayers in the coming days as we seek God's leadership in folding together our two successful programs into one even more successful endeavor. &nbsp;

Our prayer is that Bridges Safehouse and Hope Mansioncan work together to create more effective "Bridges to Hope" for countless women and children in desperate need of the residential services we provide and the love and forgiveness that only God can offer. &nbsp;

Respectfully,

**Hope Mansion**
