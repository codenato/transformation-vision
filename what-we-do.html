        <p>People from all walks of life claim Cedar Hill as their place to live, work, and/or play. Our city is centered by the best in politics, economics, government, churches, educational institutions and social structures.  But our city also has a line that separates the rich from the poor, the strong from the weak, the haves from the have nots.  That line may be a street, a sidewalk, a train track or a creek. It is a line that must be crossed if we are to see our city transformed.</p>
        <p>The heart of Transformation Vision is to cross the lines that separate us and serve all of those represented in our city and community.  Meeting the needs of the community not only makes a significant difference in people’s lives, but it also reveals the power of the Gospel to affect change in their hearts. We believe God’s heart for the broken and downtrodden can be expressed most powerfully in our city by our willingness to partner with the Kingdom of God at work here.</p>
        <p>Transformation Vision seeks to engage the city on every level – spiritually, socially, and economically – for individuals, neighborhoods and communities. In order to do this, we have a three part strategy by which we seek to effect change:</p>

        <p>We believe very strongly in the power of prayer, serving the community through acts of kindness and loving those who are less fortunate.  By praying for, serving and loving those in our community, we are following the same strategy Jesus used to reach the world. That’s why it’s so powerful.</p>
        <p>As we become committed to loving and serving the city and community where God has placed us, we will begin to see God’s kingdom advanced. If we understand the heart of God and the power of the Gospel to change lives, we can have hope for our city, no matter how dark or hopeless it might seem. The mi
