  description: "I was interested in the Transformation Serve One Another Program because the description of it sounded like something that I was already trying to do in my life and my business. I found the training to be very enlightening and inspiring. The presenters were all interesting and knowledgeable. I learned a lot and have since sent 4 of my employees through the training. I truly wish that all of the businesses in Cedar Hill would find it as important as I did to have their employees attend the Serve One Another Program. It would be so nice to shop and dine in a city where all of us treated each other the way that we would like to be treated, according to the Kingdom of God Principles!"
